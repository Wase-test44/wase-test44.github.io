    <h2>Organisational History</h2>
    <p>
      The AREWA Progressive Eagle Movement was founded with a passionate vision to unify, empower, and advance the people of Northern Nigeria through strategic civic engagement, environmental sustainability, and socioeconomic development. Since its inception, the organization has committed itself to addressing critical challenges such as desertification, youth unemployment, lack of awareness on government interventions, and weak community-level engagement in national development.
    </p>
    <p>
      From grassroots mobilization to high-level advocacy, AREWA Progressive Eagle Movement has launched multiple initiatives including the flagship Oil Palm Tree Planting Project aimed at economic diversification and environmental regeneration. With a strong belief in the values of unity, progress, and service, the Movement continues to grow across the 19 Northern states and the FCT, building a network of dedicated volunteers, coordinators, and partners driving change at all levels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The movement operates independently, often funding its own activities, yet remains open to strategic collaborations and support from patriotic stakeholders committed to a cleaner, greener, and more prosperous AREWA.
