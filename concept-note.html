  <h1>Concept Note</h1>

  <p>Highly esteemed and distinguished fellows,</p>

  <p>You are aware, that terrorism and the violence and insecurity, current environmental issues such as pollution, environmental degradation, resources depletion, Ozone layer depletion, current environmental health issues, climate change including lower rainfall has led to competition and sometimes conflict over limited resources. Deforestation and overgrazing have further denuded our environment which the largely nomadic fulanis rely on to survive and has led many of them to migrate to different areas, putting pressure on already stretched basic services, such as health and education.</p>

  <p>AREWA have been battling with multi-dimensional security situations including the Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east, farmer-herders as well as ethno-religious conflicts in the north-central and banditry in the north-west.</p>

  <p>We are blessed with rich and abundant natural resources, yet we are living with hunger and in poverty. Our land is good for agriculture but we are being discouraged from going into farming. The seeds we are cultivating are not producing high and quality yield. We lack adequate value chains for our agricultural commodities. Banditry, insurgency and other crimes affected both crops and animals farming that provides raw-materials to our industries. These accumulated problems caused staff layoffs, shut down of industries and displaced investors; that is why our youths migrate to other areas for survival.</p>

  <p>Industrial waste, heavy metal contamination in the environment has greatly affected human health and the ecosystem. It contributes to global warming, climate change, air, soil and water pollution, human diseases and species extinction. There is low performance of workers in our industries. Most of our youths are not willing to work with the private organizations. Our corporate organizations are not much concerned about carrying out their corporate social responsibilities that is why many could not survive when there is bear market.</p>

  <p>Our population is speedily increasing, our economic resources are dwindling, hardship is everywhere, life is becoming unbearable and the government is facing myriad of problems including security and corruption due to failure in our responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen and ladies, I welcome you all to this noble and unique organization, "AREWA PROGRESSIVE EAGLE MOVEMENT" â€“ a solution-driven association that is aimed at projecting AREWA to a new dawn. It's a non-profit and non-governmental organization which has its members across all the northern Nigerian states. Friends of the Northern Nigeria who are living in the North and have good fortune for the Northern Nigeria are also welcome.</p>

  <p>The northern Nigeria is happy to have you on board and is proud of your potentials and is waiting to benefit through your ideas, exhibitions and programs.</p>

  <p><strong>Thank you and stay blessed.</strong></p>

  <p><strong>Babangida Ibrahim Dauda<br>Founder/Chairman</strong></p>
