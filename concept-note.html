  <p>Highly esteemed and distinguished fellows,</p>

  <p>You are aware that terrorism, violence, and insecurity, coupled with current environmental issues such as pollution, environmental degradation, resources depletion, ozone layer depletion, environmental health issues, and climate change including lower rainfall have led to competition and sometimes conflict over limited resources. Deforestation and overgrazing have further denuded our environment which the largely nomadic Fulanis rely on to survive and has led many of them to migrate to different areas, putting pressure on already stretched basic services, such as health and education.</p>

  <p><span class="highlight">AREWA</span> has been battling with multi-dimensional security situations including the Boko Haram insurgency in the north-east, farmer-herders conflicts as well as ethno-religious conflicts in the north-central, and banditry in the north-west.</p>

  <p>We are blessed with rich and abundant natural resources, yet we are living with hunger and in poverty. Our land is good for agriculture but we are being discouraged from going into farming. The seeds we are cultivating are not producing high and quality yield. We lack adequate value chains for our agricultural commodities. Banditry, insurgency and other crimes have affected both crops and animal farming that provide raw materials to our industries. These accumulated problems have caused staff layoffs, shutdown of industries and displaced investors; that is why our youths migrate to other areas for survival.</p>

  <p>Industrial waste and heavy metal contamination in the environment has greatly affected human health and the ecosystem. It contributes to global warming, climate change, air, soil and water pollution, human diseases and species extinction. There is low performance of workers in our industries. Most of our youths are not willing to work with private organizations. Our corporate organizations are not much concerned about carrying out their corporate social responsibilities which is why many could not survive when there is a bear market.</p>

  <p>Our population is speedily increasing, our economic resources are dwindling, hardship is everywhere, life is becoming unbearable and the government is facing myriad of problems including security and corruption due to failure in our responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Gentlemen and ladies, I welcome you all to this noble and unique organization, <span class="highlight">"AREWA PROGRESSIVE EAGLE MOVEMENT"</span> â€“ a solution-driven association that is aimed at projecting AREWA to a new dawn. It's a non-profit and non-governmental organization which has its members across all the northern Nigerian states. Friends of the Northern Nigeria who are living in the North and have good fortune for the Northern Nigeria are also welcome.</p>

  <p>The northern Nigeria is happy to have you on board and is proud of your potentials and is waiting to benefit through your ideas, exhibitions and programs.</p>
